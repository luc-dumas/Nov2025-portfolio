title: About Me


content: |
  I started my professional career at **WeVideo/PlayPosit**, where I worked across a large Vue + Node.js + MySQL ecosystem. I contributed to major platform upgrades, including the migration of PlayPosit from **Vue 2 → Vue 3** and helped build out the React rewrite of the product. I also integrated PlayPosit into the broader WeVideo platform and collaborated with backend teams moving services from Express/MySQL to Java/Oracle.

  Since then, I've focused on building my own products and working directly with clients. I run **Union Web Solutions**, where I design and develop custom websites, small business tools, and early-stage SaaS apps. My current work includes a **full-stack invoicing platform** built with Nuxt 3 + Supabase, along with a growing library of internal tools for small businesses.

  When I’m not coding, I’m usually traveling, learning languages, or building something with my hands. I’ve gone through many phases... cabinetry, timber framing, campervan builds, and plenty more. Making things has always been a huge part of who I am.
  Here are a few photos of projects I’ve worked on!
